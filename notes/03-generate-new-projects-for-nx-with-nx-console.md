**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-generate-new-projects-for-nx-with-nx-console)**

In Nx, you will usually use the command line to generate new things.

You can install the Visual Studio Code extension [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/latest/react/cli/console#nx-console) from the [VS Code extension tab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console)

This extension allows you to have a better view of your workspace, what projects you have, common Nx commands and also run project commands.

Using Nx Console will help you save time looking for the commands available in Nx by using the CLI.
